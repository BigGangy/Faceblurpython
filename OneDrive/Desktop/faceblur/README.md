# Blur Faces and Eyes in Video

This code is a Python script that uses the OpenCV library to blur the faces and eyes in a video. It stores the new, blured video in a folder called "Blured Faces" and maintains the blur even when the face or eyes change position.

## Requirements

- opencv-python

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Place the video files that you want to blur in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the script by typing `python blur_faces.py` in the command line.
4. The new, blured videos will be stored in the "Blured Faces" folder.
